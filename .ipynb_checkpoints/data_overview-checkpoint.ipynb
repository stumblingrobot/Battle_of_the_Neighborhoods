    "The dataset we are using is *Collisions - All Years* dataset maintained by the SDOT Traffic Management Division's Traffic Records Group.  This dataset includes all types of collisions, including car, bicycle, and pedestrian as provided by the Seattle Police Department in their Traffic Records.\n",
    "\n",
    "The data set contains information on over 194,000 collisions in Seattle over a 15-year period.  The primary attribute we are looking to predict is the severity of the collision as captured by the Severity Code assigned to the collision.  Interestingly, the dataset description provided by SDOT indicates this Severity Code attribute should take values between 0 and 3 (including both 2 and 2b to differential \"injury\" from \"serious injury\"); however, the actual data set only contains the values 1 and 2 for this attribute.  One avenue to explore in a future project is to find additional information on this target attribute.\n",
    "\n",
    "The data includes 37 different features including: day, time, month, lighting conditions, road conditions and weather conditions.\n",
